# Deployment-Automation-Solution
This solution provides SCCM Administrators with an option to automate and easily delegate software distribution in their environment.

It consits of two parts, Deployment Creator and AutoScript. Both parts are written in powershell and may be modified to suit oneâ€™s needs.

 

It is capable of

 - creating collections and membership rules of types direct, ad query, include or exclude collections

 - deploying applications and packages

 - checking consistency of configured deployments

 

Thanks to this solution you no longer have to go through deployment wizards as long as the desired settings is standardized. It greatly simplifies the entire process, meaning that lower level teams are able to handle SW distribution too. For this I would recommend you use some kind of a template where the requestor puts the application(s) which should be deployed and a list users and/or computers.

 

More information can be found in attached zip file which contains the whole documentation.

 

I would appreciate your feedback and ideas!
